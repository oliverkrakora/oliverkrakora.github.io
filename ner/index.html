	<h1>Neo Emotional Release</h1>
	<p>Are you carrying emotions within you and don’t know how to deal with them?
You have tried different modalities but still feel the heaviness within? A Neo Emotional Release(NER) Session might be the right thing for you. During a session we explore what is alive in the present moment and you will get a different perspective on your emotions by getting in touch with them in a loving way, rather than pushing them away or trying to get rid of them we allow the emotions to be fully explored so that you can redefine your relationship to them.
